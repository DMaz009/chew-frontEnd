# CHEW
The purpose of CHEW is to solve a problem that many buisness have, a terrible website. Chew is a website templating service for all different types of restaurants.

CHEW allows you to select a website and have the restaurant details and menu populate in the appropriate sections of the page. You are also able to make reservations for a party of however many people you want to the restaurant.
